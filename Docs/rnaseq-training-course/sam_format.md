* SAM / BAM File Structure
We will give an quick overview of the SAM and BAM formats here. Note that this overview serves more to remind you what the formats are about and are not meant to teach how to use the SAM and BAM format.

The following shows an example of a SAM file.
```
@HD VN:1.3  SO:coordinate

@SQ SN:ref2 LN:40

```
SAM files are TSV (tab-separated-values) files and begin with an optional header. The header consists of multiple lines, starting with an '@' character, each line is a record. 

Each record starts with its identifier and is followed by tab-separated tags. 

Each tag in the header consists of a two-character identifier, followed by ':', followed by the value.

|Record Name	|Tag 1 |Description | Tag2 | Description|
| ----------- |---------------|----------- |---------------|--------|
|@HD	|VN|	SAM version|SO	|sort order|
|@SQ	|SN|	the reference sequence names| LN| sequence lengths|

There also are other header record types.

The optional header section is followed by the alignment records. The alignment records are again tab-separated. There are 11 mandatory columns.


|Col|	Field	Type|	N/A Value	|Description|
| ----------- |---------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
|1	|QNAME|	string|	mandatory	The query/read name.|
|2	|FLAG	|int|	mandatory	The recordâ€™s flag.|
|3	|RNAME|	string|	*	|The reference name.|
|4	|POS	|32-bit int|	0	|1-based position on the reference.|
|5	|MAPQ	|8-bit int|	255	|The mapping quality.|
|6	|CIGAR	|string	|*	|The CIGAR string of the alignment.|
|7|	RNEXT|	string|	*	|The reference of the next mate/segment.|
 |8	|PNEXT|	string|	0	|The position of the next mate/seqgment.|
|9|	TLEN|	string|	0	|The observed length of the template.|
|10	|SEQ|	string|	*|	The query/read sequence.|
|11|	QUAL|	string|	*	|The ASCII PHRED-encoded base qualities.|


BAM files store their header as plain-text SAM headers. However, they additionally store the name and length information about the reference sequences. This information is mandatory since in BAM, the alignment records only contain the numeric ids of the reference sequences. Thus, the name is stored outside the record in the header.
