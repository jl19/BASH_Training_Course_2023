#DNA-seq (WES) Data Analysis

Who is this course for?

The course focuses






### [Day1](dna-seq-wes-data-analysis-day1.md)


* Pre-processing and Perform QC of sequencing data
* Align raw reads to reference sequences 
* Perform alignment metric and generating a QC report 
* Prepare alignment data for variant calling 

###Understand the basics of the NGS technologies
####


Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is used to determine the order of nucleotides in entire genomes or targeted regions of DNA or RNA.

The typical NGS process involves:

* Fragmenting DNA/RNA into multiple pieces.
* Adding adapters
* Sequencing the libraries
* Reassembling them to forma genomic sequence.

Advantages of NGS:



* Higher sensitivity to detect low-frequency variants
* Higher genomic coverage
* To be able to sequence hundreds to thoursands of genes or gene regions simultaneously. Higher sample throughput

| File      | Description                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `Single-end`       | Each  read is a single sequence from one end of a DNA fragment (single fastq file). The fragment is usually 200-800bp long, with the amount being read can be chosen between 50 and 300 bp  |
| `Paired-end`       | Each read is two sequences (a pair) from each end of the same DNA fragment. The distance between the reads on the original genome sequence is equal to the length of the DNA fragment that was sequenced, usually 200-800 bp |
| `Mate-pair`    | Each read is two sequences from each end of the same DNA fragment, but the distance between the reads on the original genome sequence is much longer, e.g. 3000-10000 bp

###Perform QC for better downstream analysis (FastQC, FASTQ files)

[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)

* To identify potential issues before data analysis

*  Base calling accuracy, measured by the Phred quality score (Q score), is the most common metric used to assess the accracy of a sequencing platform.  It indicates the probablity that a given base is called incorrectly by the sequencer.



Q = âˆ’ 10 log 10 P 20 1 in 100 99%
For example, if Phred assigns a Q score of 30 (Q30) to a base, this is
equivalent to the probability of an incorrect base call 1 in 1000 times
(Table 1). This means that the base call accuracy (i.e., the probability of
a correct base call) is 99.9%. A lower base call accuracy of 99% (Q20)
will have an incorrect base call probability of 1 in 100, meaning that
every 100 bp sequencing read will likely contain an error. When se-
quencing quality reaches Q30, virtually all of the reads will be perfect,
having zero errors and ambiguities. This is why Q30 is considered a
benchmark for quality in next-generation sequencing. 


Phred Quality Score          Probability of Incorrect Base Call    Base Call Accuracy
10                              1 in 10                             90%
20                              1 in 100                            99%
30                              1 in 1,000                          99.9%
40                              1 in 10,000                         99.99%
50                              1 in 100,000                        99.999%
